When the application is run, it shows the login page where the user can choose whether he or she is an attendant or admin.
If the user selects attendants and provides the right credentials to log in, he or she would be logged into the order section of the app where they can take orders.
if the user selects admin and provides the right credentials, he or she would be logged into the main interface of the app which contains everything about the app (no restrictions).
for the purpose of the demonstration the following credentials would be used.
Admin email= admin@admin.com
admin password= admin
attendant email= attendant@attendant.com
attendant password= attendant

The video shows how the app works.
